## Introduction

The **Dustmap Mobile Companion App** accomplishes our [Mobile Dustmap Air Quality Sensor Node based on the Sensirion SPS30](https://github.com/dustmap/dustnet-node-mobile). It is used both as a GPS provider for the current position and a screen to present results.

A more detailed intoduction can be found on this [Netidee blog post](https://www.netidee.at/dustmap/die-app-zum-feinstaub) (German).

**Available soon for both iOS and Android.**

## Features

The application connects to a Dustmap Mobile Node via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). It can run as a background task and combines the users current position with the air quality measured by the mobile sensor. The user can also see past measurements and locations.

## Roadmap

Plans for the future development of the app are to fully support the Dustmap API. This includes an in-app map and the registration of new stationary sensors.
